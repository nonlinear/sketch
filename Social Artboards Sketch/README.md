# Artboard presets for social media images
This is a Plugin for [Sketch App](http://www.sketchapp.com) that adds artboard presets for the most common image dimensions of
different social media platforms.

## Installation
Install this plugin via [Sketch Toolbox](http://sketchtoolbox.com) or download the package manually into to your Sketch3 Plugin Folder. The path should resemble the following
```.../com.bohemiancoding.sketch3/Plugins/social-artboards-sketch-master``` **Note:** The .sketchplugin file needs to reside in a directory!

Afterwards, manually start an installation routine (once) within the Sketch App itself. Either goto the plugins menu and select Social Artboards -> Install Social Artboards or use keyboard shortcut
```Alt + Crtl + I```. Afterwards you will find a new group called ```Social``` whenever you select to create a new artboard (press the `A` key) in the right column of your App.

### What's inside

### That's all folks
This is my first Sketch Plugin, so please feel free to [contact me](http://bit.ly/1MSRFbd) via twitter for comments, suggestions and critique. This has been so much fun, more will follow.
If you like it consider giving this repository a star! If you're owning Bitcoin feel free to send some satoshis: `1BoFajaVNQ5Z8a3E7ZQvt8sWyTCGrxRtS9`. You can fork and contribute to the code and extend this package - I will happily merge any tested PRs.
