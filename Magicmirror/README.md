Magic Mirror is a Sketch Plugin originally developed to add a critical feature thats missing in Sketch 3 - Perspective Transform Tool for Images.

Version 2 has a number of improvements over its precedance:

- 5x better performance
- 2-6x image quality improvement
- live update (ya you've heard it right)
- persistant toolbar for quick access

All of this thanks to the dynamic nature of Objective-C which allows us to have a way to completely rewritten the plugin in native language.
